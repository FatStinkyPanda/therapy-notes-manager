# Metadata for: src/gui/tabs/client_tab.py

## File Purpose
This file defines the "Clients" tab in the main application window. It is responsible for displaying the list of clients and providing controls for managing them.

## Dependencies
- **Internal**:
  - `src.gui.dialogs.add_client_dialog.AddClientDialog`
  - `src.gui.dialogs.batch_import_dialog.BatchImportDialog`
  - `src.core.client_manager.ClientManager`
- **External**:
  - `tkinter`
  - `ttkbootstrap`

## Integration Points
- **Instantiated by**: `src.gui.main_window.MainWindow`
- **Uses**: `AddClientDialog` and `BatchImportDialog` to add clients.
- **Interacts with**: `ClientManager` to manage the list of clients.

## State Management
- Manages the state of the client list displayed in the treeview.

## Error Handling
- Validation for client data will be handled in the dialogs and `ClientManager`.

## Performance Considerations
- For a large number of clients, the treeview might become slow. Virtualization could be considered in the future if needed.

## Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Verify that the tab initializes correctly.
  - Check that the treeview and buttons are created.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test that the "Add Client" button opens the `AddClientDialog`.
  - Test that the "Batch Import" button opens the `BatchImportDialog`.
