# Therapy Notes Manager

**A powerful, secure, and intuitive desktop application for therapists to manage client notes, workbooks, and sessions.**

This project was developed in less than 48 hours from start to finish using the **PANDA (Project Architecture & Networked Development Assistant) system**, a revolutionary documentation-driven development methodology. You can learn more about the PANDA system at [github.com/fatstinkypanda/panda](https://github.com/fatstinkypanda/panda).

### The PANDA System

This project was developed using the **PANDA (Project Architecture & Networked Development Assistant) system**. This system is a documentation-driven development methodology that allows for rapid development and seamless project management.

The PANDA system is based on a set of core principles:

*   **Documentation as Code:** All project knowledge is stored in documentation files, which are treated as code.
*   **Total System Awareness:** Every file modification triggers a cascade of updates across all connected documentation.
*   **Synchronization Protocol:** All documentation is kept in sync with the code at all times.
*   **Quality Enforcement:** All code is production-ready and includes comprehensive error handling.

The PANDA system allowed for the rapid development of this project, from concept to completion, in less than 48 hours.
